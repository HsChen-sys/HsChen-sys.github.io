## About Me
I am Haisheng Chen, a master's student at ECE, UC San Diego and a research intern in [Z Lab](https://z-lab.ai/), under the supervision of [Dr. Zhijian Liu](https://zhijianliu.com/). My research centers on efficient LLM -- everything from model quantization and sparse-attention to building inference systems.

Before coming to UC San Diego, I spent a gap year at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en.html)’s Shanghai office as a full-time GPU software intern. There, I gained a deep understanding of GPU architectures and honed my skills in developing high-performance CUDA kernels. I also helped enable AMD’s support for the vLLM inference framework—designing Docker-based deployment pipelines and troubleshooting a variety of compatibility issues along the way.

I’m passionate about contributing to open-source LLM inference projects like [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang). Just like countless other community-driven initiatives, these systems thrive on collaboration from developers around the world. And beyond the thrill of low-level optimizations, I find it endlessly fascinating to put billions of matmuls and other computations into producing what feels like intelligence.  

## Career Goal
I will graduate from UC San Diego in December 2025. I am now actively seeking roles in the LLM systems industry. I am open to opportunities based in the United States or China and eager to contribute to efficient large-scale LLM deployment.  

## About this site
This site is designed with the following goals in mind:

1. **Discuss LLM System Technical Details**  
   Dive into the architectures, optimizations, and implementation tricks that power large-language-model inference systems.

2. **Showcase Research Projects**
